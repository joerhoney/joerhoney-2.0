              Today, it is rare that a business can succeed without some kind of
              online presence, whether it's a good Yelp!<sup>Â®</sup> page, a
              business profile on Google<sup>Â®</sup> Maps, or a website,
              complete with an address, a presentation of products/services,
              etc. But these things are not hard to obtain. In fact, you've
              found the right place to get answers and real help. :j

              I love helping small to mid-sized businesses grow! Independent,
              privately-owned shops are the backbone of our economy (and our
              country! ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸). If your business isn't flourishing and prospering
              enough for your liking, keep reading to see how a good online
              presence can help you with that.
