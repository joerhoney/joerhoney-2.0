            <h2>Grow Online</h2>
            <p>
              Today, it is rare that a business can succeed without some kind of
              online presence, whether it's a good Yelp!<sup>¬Æ</sup> page, a
              business profile on Google<sup>¬Æ</sup> Maps, or a website,
              complete with an address, a presentation of products/services,
              etc. But these things are not hard to obtain. In fact, you've
              found the right place to get answers and real help. :j
            </p>
            <p>
              If you need a website, need a better one, or just need a web
              solution, here are my basic website packages to get your started.
            </p>
            <h4>Set it &amp; forget it! üëè</h4>
            <p>
              Many web developers want to charge a steady monthly rate,
              regardless of how much work they do for you. I only charge for
              what I deliver. Once your website is built you can let it sit
              there as long as you want at no cost from me. I'm here if you ever
              need me.
