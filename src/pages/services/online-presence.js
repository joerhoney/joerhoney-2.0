            <p>
              I love helping small to mid-sized businesses grow! Independent,
              privately-owned shops are the backbone of our economy (and our
              country! ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸). If your business isn't flourishing and prospering
              enough for your liking, keep reading to see how a good online
              presence can help you with that.
