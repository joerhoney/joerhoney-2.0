              If you need a website, need a better one, or just need a web
              solution, here are my basic website packages to get your started.
            </p>
            <h4>Set it &amp; forget it! üëè</h4>
            <p>
              Many web developers want to charge a steady monthly rate,
              regardless of how much work they do for you. I only charge for
              what I deliver. Once your website is built you can let it sit
              there as long as you want at no cost from me. I'm here if you ever
              need me.
            </p>
            <h4>Seariously Dirt Cheap! üíµ</h4>
            <p>
              Hosting costs money every year and the price keeps going up... but
              not with the dirt cheap package. Yep. And it doesn't require
              sacrificing your domain name. If you just need a spot on the web,
              don't pay for a full hosting package. Go dirt cheap!
            </p>

        <section className="alignable compensateB" id="contact">
          <div className="article">
            <h4 id="ssl">SSL Certificates</h4>
            <p>
              SSL Based on hosting service. Note: Cost is baked into the the
              estimated hosting cost where applicable.
            </p>
            <h4 id="pages-added">Pages/Products Added for You</h4>
            <p>Plus $60 for each additional page/product added for you.</p>
