            <strong>TLDR;</strong> Lifetime artist, found a career in design in
            1999, which quickly lead to a web development opportunity, and I've
            been designing and coding ever since... and my family and I lived
            happily ever after. üòÅ

          <h2>Journey of an Artist</h2>
          <p>
            I have been an artist since my childhood in rural Northern
            California. I spent most of my free time creating and designing
            fictional vehicles, characters and creatures to be featured in a
            comic book series one day. As a teenager I began exploring my
            ability to produce music but continued practicing illustration.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a top art student I was granted the opportunity to attend the
            CSSSA program (California State Summer School for the Arts), located
            at the CalArts campus. There I gained a world of knowledge and
            experience in traditional animation.
          </p>
          <p>
            The next year (1998), I moved to Southern California where life now
            seemed to be traveling a million miles per hour. I held various jobs
            until I landed my first design opportunity in 1999, at a web
            marketing agency called Success Makers. Within the first two weeks
            they needed me to learn HTML, so I quickly began my career as a web
            developer at the same time.
          </p>
          <p>
            In a few years' time, I began picking up odd jobs, creating various
            illustrations acquaintances needed for marketing and other purposes.
            Soon I became familiar with the processes of freelancing.
            Freelancing has also greatly facilitated the opportunity to
            self-train and gain a wide range of experiences.
          </p>
          <p>
            And the rest is pretty much history. I have been working graphic
            design and web developer jobs since then. üôÇ
