          <h2>Journey of an Artist</h2>
          <p>
            I have been an artist since my childhood, in Northern California. I
            spent most of my free time designing fictional vehicles, characters
            and creatures to be featured in a comic book series one day. As a
            teenager I began exploring my ability to produce music, but
            continued practicing illustration.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a top art student I was granted the opportunity to attend the
            CSSSA program (California State Summer School for the Arts),
            administored at the CalArts campus. There I gained a world of
            knowledge and experience in tradition animation.
          </p>
          <p>
            The next year (1998), I moved to Southern California where life was
            now traveling a million miles per hour. I soon got to work at
            K-mart, but I knew I had to put my talent to work in order to afford
            the living costs in the big city. My first design job began in 1999
            at a web marketing agency called Success Makers. Within the first
            two weeks needed me to learn HTML, so I quickly began my career as a
            web developer at the same time.
          </p>
          <p>
            In a few more years time, I began picking up odd jobs, illustrating
            portraits and various ideas needed for marketing and other purposes.
            Soon I had to become familier with freelancing and how to report
            taxes for that. Being able to freelance has saved me between jobs.
            It has also greatly facilitated the opportunity to self-train and
            gain a wide range of experiences.
          </p>
          <p>
            And the rest is pretty much history. I have been working graphic
            design and web developer jobs since then. üôÇ
