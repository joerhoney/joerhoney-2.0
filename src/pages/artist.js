              This collection of art will include work I've done professionally
              and on my own time... Patience, my friend. I'm afraid coding is a
              higher priority right now. 🤪

              This was originally a flipbook I made. I scanned all of the pages
              into Photoshop, where I added color and fabricated the background,
              a combination of digital montage, brush strokes, glow effects and
              transforms.
