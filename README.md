# joerhoney-2.0

This is my Gatsby version of [joerhoney.com](https://joerhoney.com).

## Notes to Self

### JS Import Conventions

1st sort by type in this order:

1. Libraries (React)
2. Utilities
3. Components
4. Layouts
5. Fragments
6. CSS
7. Images

2nd sort alphabetically by file name, not by component name ( since there are sometimes multiple components in one import).

Add comments to show the categories (except for React).
